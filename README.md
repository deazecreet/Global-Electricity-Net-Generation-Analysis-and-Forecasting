# Global-Electricity-Net-Generation-Analysis-and-Forecasting

## Overview
This project conducts an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Time Series Analysis on global electricity net generation data. Utilizing Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and statsmodels, we explore trends, patterns, and forecasts in electricity production across various regions and countries from 1980 to 2021.

## Dataset
The dataset, "Global Electricity Net Generation Statistics.csv," encompasses annual electricity net generation data across different countries and regions worldwide. The analysis aims to understand the growth trends, regional production differences, and future electricity generation forecasting.

## Key Findings
1. Significant growth in electricity production, particularly in the Asia and Oceania region.
2. The existence of a global trend towards increasing electricity production, with notable disparities between countries.
3. Through Time Series Analysis and ARIMA modeling, we forecast future electricity net generation trends, highlighting the necessity for sustainable energy policies.

## Analysis Highlights
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for analysis readiness.
- Visual exploration of electricity net generation distributions and trends over time and by region.
- Time Series decomposition to identify and analyze underlying patterns.
- ARIMA model building for forecasting future net generation trends.
- Insights and conclusions regarding global electricity production and sustainability considerations.
